# Ascii-Player

Basic idea for a website of the idea of: <i>Upload a video and it plays it back in ascii in browser</i>. The website can be found [here](https://jer-tran.github.io/ascii-player/)
Inspired by the trend of music video [Bad Apple](https://youtu.be/FtutLA63Cp8) being playable on anything, so I'm trying to do my part here.
This webapp uses pure JS

As is, the website allows for image and video upload and playback. There are currently features to change the ascii detail and size, as well as a volume slider. There is a lot of room for improvements to user experience but that's for future feature development.
